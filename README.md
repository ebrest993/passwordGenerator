## THIS IS A GENERATE PASSWORD WEBSITE

Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, a series of events occur:

## 1: LENGTH OF PASSWORD

The user is instructed to enter a number between 8 and 128 to determine just how long their password will be.
If they choose a number less than 8 or more than 128, they are told to enter a value between 8 and 128.
They are then sent back to the first step.

## 2: UPPERCASE INCLUSION

A confirm window appears asking if the user would like uppercase letters to be included in their password.
They click "ok" for yes or "cancel" for no.

## 3: LOWERCASE INCLUSION

A confirm window appears asking if the user would like lowercase letters to be included in their password.
They click "ok" for yes or "cancel" for no.

## 4: NUMBER INCLUSION

A confirm window appears asking if the user would like numbers to be included in their password.
They click "ok" for yes or "cancel" for no.

## 5: SPECIAL CHARACTER INCLUSION

A confirm window appears asking if the user would like special characters to be included in their password.
They click "ok" for yes or "cancel" for no.

## 5a: ERROR

If the user selects a length of characters between 8 and 128, and then selects "cancel" for every subsequent confirm window, an alert appears informing them they have to select at least one category to be included in their password.
They then have to start from the beginning by clicking the "Generate Password" button.

## 6: PASSWORD DISPLAY

The generated password is finally generated and displayed in the text area, replacing the placeholder "Your Secure Password".
